      <h2>What Counts as a Cheap Hotel in Kuantan?</h2>
      <p>In Kuantan, budget hotels typically range between RM35 and RM100 per night depending on season and amenities. These properties prioritize a clean, comfortable room with basic conveniences - air conditioning, private bathroom, Wi-Fi, and a TV - rather than luxury services. For many travelers, these hotels offer everything needed for short stays or long, economical trips.</p>

      <h2>Best Areas to Find Budget Stays</h2>
      <p>Location matters. Pick an area that matches your travel plans so you avoid wasting time and transport money.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>City Centre:</strong> Staying downtown places you within walking distance of shops, restaurants, and transport links. It's ideal for first-time visitors who want convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Teluk Cempedak / Balok:</strong> If the beach is your main draw, accommodation near Teluk Cempedak or Balok gives you quick access to coastlines and seaside activities. Prices here may be slightly higher but the beachfront payoff is worth it.</li>
        <li><strong>Guesthouses & Homestays:</strong> For the tightest budgets, guesthouses and homestays provide basic comfort with a local touch - often run by families and offering insight into daily life.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Recommended Budget Hotels</h2>
      <p>Here are a few well-rated, budget-friendly options to consider if you want a mix of comfort and value:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The V Hotel:</strong> A modern, affordable choice near East Coast Mall and Teluk Cempedak, offering clean rooms at reasonable rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Skytree Hotel:</strong> Central location and cozy rooms, suitable for travelers who want access to city services.</li>
        <li><strong>Classic Boutique Hotel:</strong> Stylish on a budget - a boutique feel with modest pricing.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun Inns Rest House Kuantan:</strong> One of the most affordable chains, geared toward backpackers and budget travelers.</li>
        <li><strong>Tropical Villa Kuantan:</strong> A relaxed, budget option for those preferring quieter surroundings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Choose a Cheap Hotel?</h2>
      <p>Budget hotels come with clear advantages. The most obvious is cost savings: lower nightly rates free up funds for food, excursions, or souvenirs. They also tend to place you closer to local life - markets, small eateries, and street food stalls - so you can experience authentic Kuantan without a tourist premium. Finally, budget properties are flexible and can cater to a wide range of travelers, from solo backpackers to small families.</p>

      <h2>Smart Booking Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Book ahead:</strong> Popular weekends and holiday periods sell out fast - reserve early to lock in the lowest rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Compare prices:</strong> Use booking platforms to find promotions; don't forget to check the hotel's own page for direct deals.</li>
        <li><strong>Read recent reviews:</strong> Cleanliness and service levels can vary among budget hotels - prioritize recent guest feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Be flexible with dates:</strong> Weekday stays are usually cheaper than weekends.</li>
        <li><strong>Check location:</strong> Pick a hotel near the places you plan to visit to reduce transport costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Visit</h2>
      <p>The best weather for beach activities is generally from March through October. During those months, expect more visitors and slightly higher room rates. The monsoon season from November to February brings heavier rain and stronger seas, which can mean lower prices - a good time for budget travelers who don't mind occasional showers.</p>

      <h2>What to Expect</h2>
      <p>Cheap hotels won't usually have extensive amenities like pools or gyms. Rooms may be smaller and services limited, but with smart choices and realistic expectations, many budget hotels deliver comfortable stays and friendly staff. Always verify check-in/out times and whether breakfast or Wi-Fi are included to avoid surprises.</p>
